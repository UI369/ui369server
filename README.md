# [Your App Name] Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up the application on a new computer.

## Prerequisites

- Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [this-repo]
   cd [this-repo-directory]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

   This uses `docker-compose.yml` to set up the docker & postgres service.

3. **Start the Docker Containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command starts the containers in detached mode. You can check the logs anytime using `docker-compose logs`.

4. **Initialize the PostgreSQL Database**

   If you have an initialization script (e.g., `init.sql`), you can run it to set up your database schema and initial data:

   ```bash
   cat path/to/init.sql | docker exec -i [your-postgres-container-name] psql -U [your-db-user] -d [your-db-name]
   ```

   Replace the placeholders (`[...]`) with your actual values.

5. **Install Application Dependencies**

   If your application requires any dependencies (e.g., Node.js packages), install them:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

6. **Run the Application**

   Depending on how you've set up your application, start it:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

7. **Access the Application**

   Open your browser and navigate to the application's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with Docker, ensure Docker is running on your machine.
- For database-related issues, check the logs using `docker-compose logs [your-postgres-container-name]`.
- Ensure all environment variables and configurations are correctly set.

## Conclusion

You should now have the application running on your machine. For any additional setup or configuration details specific to the app, refer to the application's documentation or contact the development team.
